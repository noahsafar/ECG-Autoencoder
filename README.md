# ECG Anomaly Detection Using Autoencoders & Clustering

## Overview  
This project explores an unsupervised deep learning approach for detecting anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. By leveraging **Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE)** and **density-based clustering (DBSCAN)**, the model learns normal heartbeat patterns and identifies deviations without requiring labeled data.

## Key Features  
- **Dataset Utilization**: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database & PhysioNet 2017 Challenge Dataset for training, validation, and testing.  
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Band-pass filtering, R-peak segmentation, per-patient normalization, and RAAD-based artifact rejection to enhance signal quality.  
- **Model Architecture**: CAE trained on normal ECG signals to reconstruct waveforms, with reconstruction errors analyzed for anomaly detection.  
- **Comparative Benchmarking**: Evaluates CAE against LSTM Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and 1D CNNs.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Assesses models using **FÎ²-score, AUC-ROC, specificity, and inference time** to ensure clinical applicability.  

## Goals  
âœ” Reduce reliance on large annotated datasets for ECG anomaly detection.  
âœ” Minimize false alarms while maintaining high sensitivity for critical cardiac events.  
âœ” Develop an interpretable and reproducible model for potential real-world deployment.
